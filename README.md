=====Burnout Legacy Car Pack by Danni_isHere=====
                     v1.2

This vehicle replacement pack aims to add popular/iconic cars from previous Burnout games that weren't originally added in Paradise.

=====NOTES=====

All cars have been ripped from their respective games directly, so no updates to the models have been made. An unfortunate side effect of this means that some cars (especially Dominator, B2 and some B3 cars) look a bit out of place with their low poly count, so be aware of this before installing anything.

No deformation is included with these cars, as the exporter required to make them even work in Paradise doesn't fully support it yet. However, there is some crude deformation on the Burnout 5 Ikusa GT.

Any cars with 3D wheels will magically spawn the wheels of original car you replaced when you crash.

=====HOW TO INSTALL=====

0) BEFORE ANYTHING, make a backup of your VEHICLES folder in the BPR directory. 

Steam:  [C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\BurnoutPR]
Origin: [C:\Program Files (x86)\Origin Games\BurnoutPR]

1)  Browse any folder for a car that interests you, pictures have been provided to assist with that.

2)  Copy and paste the desired car's files (NOT the replaces.txt file or any images) into the VEHICLES folder.

3a) If the game ISN'T launched:
    - Open the game and navigate to whichever car you replaced, and it should be there.

3b) If the game IS launched:
    - If your current car at the time of replacement ISN'T the same as the modded car:
      - Change car to the modded car.

    - If your current car at the time of replacement IS the same as the modded car:
      - Change car to a car with a different parent (anything that isnt a burning route or original version of the car you're driving currently) and change back through either a menu or junkyard.

4) Enjoy!
